**PoliPhaser** is a non-OOP wrapper of the software [Phaser](https://phaser.io/), providing a
subset of functionalities. The reason behind this choice is to allow people
not familiar with programming to easily use Phaser, removing the necessity to
learn and use the complexity of Object Oriented Programming (OOP).

The wrapper is developed as part of the teaching material of the course
"Laboratorio di Computer Grafica" (Computer Graphics Lab) of Politecnico di
Milano (Italy).
